description: An energy-harvesting autonomous vessel built by students in Fall 2009
  to operate in the Charles River. It's based on a Wheeler model sailboat hull, augmented
  with two pontoons for stability, two thrusters, and a 5W solar panel. Instrumentation
  includes a sonar range sensor, a camera, GPS, compass, and a computer for control.
